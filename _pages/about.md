Hello, reader...

You've found a security researcher who loves building tools and working on hard
problems.  I enjoy making visualizations, automating things, and finding bugs,
but sometimes I also get interested by a random facets of software development
and the stories behind writing code.

I like the idea of helping people through my work and giving back more, so I'm
starting to blog and open source things that I write.  I'm big believer in the
power of what people can accomplish by working together, so if you've got more
ideas on cool ways to give back and make a positive impact, drop me a line.
